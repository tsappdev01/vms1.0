@echo off
rem  Applies the VMS database scripts, in order, with sqlcmd.
rem
rem  Runs every .sql file in this folder in filename order - which is why they are numbered.
rem  A new script is picked up by being dropped in with the right number; there is no list in
rem  here to keep in step.
rem
rem  Held back unless asked for:
rem    030_permissions.sql   needs the environment's principal names set inside it first
rem    9xx_*.sql             migration loads, which are run deliberately and once
rem
rem  Usage:
rem    apply.cmd UATWEB01 VMS bpuser bpuser
rem    apply.cmd UATWEB01 VMS                 (Windows authentication)
rem
rem  Stops on the first error and exits non-zero, so a failure is never buried under the
rem  scripts that follow it.

rem -C trusts the server certificate, which an on-premises server with a self-signed one needs.
